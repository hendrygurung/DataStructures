A-STAR PATHFINDING ALGORITHM: This project uses a simple heuristic in order to efficiently search for a path through a map and avoiding obstacles.

PUZZLE SLOVER: This puzzle consists of puzzle pieces on a grid. There is one missing piece, but you can slide the pieces around to fill that gap. You will be given an initial state for the puzzle and a goal state, and your solver will test all possible strategies for solving the puzzle, and return a step by step process for solving the puzzle.
